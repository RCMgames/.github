# Types of Robot Control Modules

## [RCM 1, 2, and 3](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide) the originals
* 4 motors
* 5 servos
* battery monitoring
* runs from 5 NiMH AA batteries
* all components are hand-solderable through-hole parts
* [get printed circuit boards ("V3")](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide/tree/main/Robot%20Control%20Module/V3) or [build by hand from a perf board ("V1")](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide/tree/main/Robot%20Control%20Module/V1)

## (under development) [RCM 4](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM-Hardware-V4) a better through-hole hand-solderable RCM
* 4 motors and 7 servos OR 6 motors and 3 servos
* runs from 5 NiMH AA batteries OR (_need to test_) 4.5-20v with the addition of voltage regulators
* all components are hand-solderable through-hole parts
* [Qwiic-Compatible](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#faqs)

## (under development) [RCM BYTE](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM-Hardware-BYTE) a smaller yet more capable design
* about 1.25x1.25 inches
* 8 motors
* 8 servos
* battery monitoring
* I2C connector on QT PY
* runs on 3-11 volts

## (under development) [RCM NIBBLE it's half a BYTE](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM-Hardware-Nibble)
* about 1x1 inches
* 4 motors
* 4 servos
* 2 additional GPIO pins
* built-in IMU
* battery monitoring
* I2C connector on QT PY
* runs on 3-11 volts
