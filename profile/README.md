### [documentation of the original RCM boards](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide)
* 4 motors
* 5 servos
* battery monitoring
* runs from 5 NiMH AA batteries
* all components are hand-solderable through-hole parts
* [get printed circuit boards ("V3")](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide/blob/main/Robot%20Control%20Module/circuit%20diagram%20and%20fritzing%20design/gerber.zip) or [build by hand from a perf board ("V1")](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM_hardware_documentation_and_user_guide/blob/main/Robot%20Control%20Module/V1%20RCM%20Build%20instructions.pdf)
